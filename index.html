        variety. It's hot, nutty, and full of exotic African flavors! Egusi soup
        is a hearty, exotic dish that will satisfy your palate. It's a staple in
        most West African households, and it's a simple one-pot meal that's
        frequently served with side dishes like Eba, Amala, Semovita, Pounded
        yam, Fufu, and other similar dishes.

      <h3>Origin of Egusi Soup</h3>
      <p>
        Nigeria!!! This soup is native to West Africa (Nigeria), and it has been
        enjoyed by both Americans and Nigerians. It's a great soup for those who
        like to try something new every now and then. Ground Egusi seeds add a
        distinct color and flavor to this soup.
      </p>

      <h3>English name for Egusi soup</h3>

      <p>
        gets its name from Igbo and Yoruba languages, and it interprets to mean
        “melon.” It is also known in West Africa as Wild watermelon, Ikpoghiri,
        Neri Niri, Ibara, Agushi, or Egusi melon. This Nigerian soup comes from
        West Africa (Nigeria). It’s a great soup for those who enjoy trying new
        things every now and then. This soup gets its color and flavor from
        ground Egusi seeds (melon seeds) If you can’t find Melon seeds, use
        pumpkin seeds as an alternative. However, in place of the shrimp, any
        combination of crab, shrimp, and smoked fish can be used. Beef can be
        replaced with drained, smoked oysters and chicken.

        Steps/Methods of Cooking Egusi Soup
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Season the meat - add some of the spice (onion, seasoning cube) to the
          meat along with enough water to cover the meat and heat the pot.
        </li>
        <li>
          While it's boiling, wash your pepper (I usually cook mine for 10
          minutes because it gives it a nice consistency) and your smoked
          catfish in hot water and salt
        </li>
        <li>
          After 10 minutes of boiling the red pepper, blend it with the yellow
          pepper, onion, and crayfish, adding a little water before blending.
          After the pepper has been blended, add the local beans (ogiri) and
          blend until cream has formed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour the blended pepper mixture over the meat and bring it to a boil.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you haven't blended your egusi, take the seed and blend it with
          extra onion and a little water until it's smooth, then pour it into a
          bowl and set it aside until your sauce begins to boil (your meat with
          the pepper mixture).
        </li>
        <li>
          If your sauce begins to boil, add your stock fish, seasoning cube, and
          everything else you're cooking with. Now wash your stock fish in the
          water before adding it to the sauce, season with a seasoning cube
          until it's to your liking, then add your catfish and salt to taste,
          and drizzle with a little oil to give it a richer flavor (this is
          optional because egusi already contains oil).
        </li>
        <li>
          After adding the oil, add the fish and stir well before bringing it to
          a boil. Before adding the egusi, taste it to ensure that the seasoning
          is adequate.
        </li>
        <li>
          After a few minutes of boiling, spread your egusi evenly throughout
          the sauce; do not stir after adding your egusi; instead, cover your
          pot halfway (leave some parts open) and cook for 3-4 minutes on medium
          heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          After about 3-4 minutes of cooking, remove the lid, stir, and combine
          the egusi with the sauce before continuing to cook.
        </li>
        <li>
          After about 4 minutes of cooking, remove the lid and give it a good
          stir; taste it to see if the salt and seasoning are sufficient.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, add your Ugu/washed Bitterleaf/frozen spinach (the spinach
          already contains some water), and cook the water for about 4-5 minutes
          while constantly stirring.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove your delicious egusi soup from the heat and serve with whatever
          you desire -Try akpu and egusi soup and thank me later.
        </li>
      </ul>
